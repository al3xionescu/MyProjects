Genetic Algorithm (GA) is a search-based optimization technique based on the principles of Genetics and Natural Selection. It is 
frequently used to find optimal or near-optimal solutions to difficult problems which otherwise would take a lifetime to solve. It is 
frequently used to solve optimization problems, in research, and in machine learning.

Advantages of GAs:
  - Does not require any derivative information (which may not be available for many real-world problems)
  - Provides a list of “good” solutions and not just a single solution
  - Always gets an answer to the problem, which gets better over the time
  - Has very good parallel capabilities

Limitations of GAs:
  - If not implemented properly, the GA may not converge to the optimal solution
  - GAs are not suited for all problems, especially problems which are simple and for which derivative information is available
  - Being stochastic, there are no guarantees on the optimality or the quality of the solution
