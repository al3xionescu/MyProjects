Visual information is the most important type of information perceived, processed and interpreted by the human brain. One third of the 
cortical area of the human brain is dedicated to visual information processing.
Digital image processing, as a computer-based technology, carries out automatic processing, manipulation and interpretation of such visual
information, and it plays an increasingly important role in many aspects of our daily life, as well as in a wide variety of disciplines and
fields in science and technology, with applications such as television, photography, robotics, remote sensing, medical diagnosis and 
industrial inspection.

• Computerized photography (e.g., Photoshop)
• Space image processing (e.g., Hubble space telescope images, interplanetary probe
images)
• Medical/Biological image processing (e.g., interpretation of X-ray images, blood/cellular
microscope images)
• Automatic character recognition (zip code, license plate recognition)
• Finger print/face/iris recognition
• Remote sensing: aerial and satellite image interpretations
• Reconnaissance
• Industrial applications (e.g., product inspection/sorting)
